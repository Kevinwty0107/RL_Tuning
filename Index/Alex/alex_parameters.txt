#define external_expectedInsertFrac 1
    Range: [0,1]  0 - read-only workloads, 1 - write-only workloads
    Default : 1

#define external_maxNodeSize 1 << 24
    Range: multiples of MB or powers of 2  (1 << 24 = 2^24 = 16MB, 
                                            1 << 20 = 2^20 = 10MB)
    Default: 1 << 24 or 16MB

#define external_approximateModelComputation true
    Range: Boolean (true/false) true - makes bulk load faster by sampling
    Defult: true

#define external_approximateCostComputation false
    Range: Boolean (true/false) true - makes bulk load faster by sampling
    Defult: true


//Experimental parameters (may break the system)
#define external_fanoutSelectionMethod 0
    Range: 0 or 1 (0 = bottom up fanout tree, 1 = top down fanout tree)
    Default: 0

#define external_splittingPolicyMethod 1
    Range: 0,1,2   (0 = always split node in 2, 
                    1 = decide between no splitting or splitting in 2, 
                    2 = split by calculate cost with fannout tree)
    Default: 0

#define external_allowSplittingUpwards false
    Range: Boolean (true/false) true - node split propagate up the tree (like B+tree)
    Default: false

//Constant parameters in ALEX
#define external_kMinOutOfDomainKeys 5
    Range: 0 - N-1, where N is number of keys. 
            Decides the minimium out of domain inserts into node before expansion. 
            (Larger means more keys before expand)
            Essentially, minimium size of the buffer before expansion.
    Default: 5

#define external_kMaxOutOfDomainKeys 1000
    Range: external_kMinOutOfDomainKeys+1 - N, where N is number of keys.
            Decides the maximium out of domain inserts into node before expansion. 
            (Larger means more keys before expand)
            Essentially, maximium size of the buffer before expansion.
    Default: 1000 (must be larger than external_kMinOutOfDomainKeys)

#define external_kOutOfDomainToleranceFactor 2
    Range: 1 - N, where N is number of keys. (This value is a factor, so 10 means 10x)
            Controls whether to expand if out-of-domain key is between min and max limits.
    Default: 2 (Don't make this value too large since it is a factor)


#define external_kMaxDensity 0.8
    Range: [0,1] Maxmium number of keys (without gaps) in each node.(Proportion to total size)
                    Decides when to expand.
    Default: 0.8 (Must be larger than kInitDensity and kMinDensity)
                kMinDensity < kInitDensity < kMaxDensity

#define external_kInitDensity 0.7
    Range: [0,1]  Number of keys (without gaps) in each node after bulkload.(Proportion to total size)
    Default: 0.7 (Must be larger than kMinDensity and smaller than kMaxDensity)
                kMinDensity < kInitDensity < kMaxDensity

#define external_kMinDensity 0.6
    Range: [0,1]  Minimium number of keys (without gaps) in each node.(Proportion to total size)
                    Decides when to contract.
    Default: 0.7 (Must be smaller than kMaxDensity and kInitDensity)
                kMinDensity < kInitDensity < kMaxDensity

#define external_kAppendMostlyThreshold 0.9
    Range: [0,1]  Determines when to consider workload is mostly append.
    Default: 0.9
